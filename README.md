# Python_Arduino_IDE1
A quick, simple editor for programming Arduino with Python... developed with Python and Qt5 
This API is base on https://pypi.org/project/arduino-python3/.
The Arduino-Python3 Command API is a lightweight Python library for communicating with Arduino 
microcontroller boards from a connected computer using standard serial IO, either over a physical 
wire or wirelessly. It is written using a custom protocol, similar to Firmata.
This allows a user to quickly prototype programs for Arduino using Python code, or to simply 
read/control/troubleshoot/experiment with hardware connected to an Arduino board without ever having
to recompile and reload sketches to the board itself.Method names within the Arduino-Python3 Command API
are designed to be as close as possible to their Arduino programming language counterparts
